  Detects the usage of options that systemd considers deprecated.
</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Some options have been  <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html#Deprecated%20Options">deprecated</a> by systemd.
You should consider replacing them with the superseding options instead. The plugin author is not sure if/when support for these options
will be terminated.</p>

<p>Other options have been disabled in a low key way, and in those cases we will provide links to the relevant documentation which might be
the release notes, or a pull request.</p>
